## Dentest

<!-- Plugin description -->
Dentest is a behavior-driven development platform that makes your Gherkin features live online so that they can be created and read by non-developers.
This plugin allows developers using Jetbrains IDEs to pull them

See the [Dentest documentation](https://docs.dentest.tech) for more details

  <kbd>Install Plugin</kbd>

  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/prollandoc/intellij-plugin/releases/latest) and install it manually using
  <kbd>Settings/Preferences</kbd> > <kbd>Plugins</kbd> > <kbd>⚙️</kbd> > <kbd>Install plugin from disk...</kbd>


## Usage

This plugin adds an extra "Dentest" menu entry with two items: "Configuration" and "Pull".
The pull action will trigger the configuration one at the first run, or in case of failure, so you can basically only use this one.

### Configuration

Some pieces of configuration are needed for this plugin to work:
- Dentest API: if you are using Dentest website, let the default value. If you have a custom installation, provide the URL of the API
- Dentest Pull Token: you need a pull token to be able to pull. See [https://docs.dentest.tech/pulling-features#retrieving-your-token](https://docs.dentest.tech/pulling-features#retrieving-your-token)
- Features destination: the directory where you want your feature to be downloaded
- Inline param wrapping string: The step sentence params can be wrapped using the string of your choice, even an empty one. By default, they are wrapped using "double quotes"
- Subsequent script: If you want to execute a script after pulling, specify it here

### Pull

You'll be able to select which features you want to pull by using this action
